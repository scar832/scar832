## Hi there 👋

# Hi, I'm Joel 👋

I'm a **Frontend Developer** (Web & Mobile) and a **UI/UX Designer** who loves crafting clean interfaces and smooth user experiences.

- 💻 Code meets design — I turn pixels into real-world products
- 📱 Mobile-first, responsive, and accessibility-aware
- ⚛️ React, React Native, Tailwind, Figma, Framer, and more
- 🌍 Always learning, always creating

Let's build something beautiful together!
